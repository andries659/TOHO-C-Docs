<summary><b><font color=#c97d42>About</font></b></summary>
<p>I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in Grade 10, and I've been coding for 1 year. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I started with TOHO first, and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod. After it died out, I decided to make a mod called <font color=purple>TOHO-C</font> to continue the mod!</p>
<p>I specialize in HTML, CSS, C# and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python.</p>
